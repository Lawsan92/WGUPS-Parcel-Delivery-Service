5d9505e Added clarifying comment on time format for user input
82a0fa6 Added get packaged status method to itinerary class. This allows the dispatcher to grab the status of the package at any given time.
e9ea236 Refined get package method to print out entire package object
9c4fe0c Renamed class instances to avoid overwriting superclasses
cd4bd2a Nested interface in while loop to facilitate continuous use
0743c84 Added package id search option in main py file
66cc56d Added handler for user input time that's between deliveries
7955a60 Added handler for invalid user input
1349fcb Added handler for edgecase where uer time input is earlier than truck departure time
77d8d8a Interface and main methods split. Interface now prints truck status based on input times
66c1e64 Cleaned up printing statements to showcase delivery algorithm and remove artifacts
6f49862 Delivery and nearest neighbor algorithms complete
a671104 Refactored delivery and nearest neighbor algorithms. Packages are no longer popped from truck, only statuses are updated. Unfinished nearest neighbor, need to account for priority packages
51187c9 Interface methods to retrieve truck data at timeframes now integrated directly in truck class
01a82d6 Created crude user interace that returns package and truck statuses based on time input by the user
45d03ed Truck 3 now departs after truck 1 returns
ddfa6b4 Added delivered packages attribute in truck class to keep log of delivered packages and their delivery time, all packages meet their deadlines
6c306a0 Refactored print methods in hash table and added delivery times to packages
47e90e3 refactored truck loading alogirthm and truck classes to manually load trucks
2e599fd changing polulation strategy, manually adding packages to trucks using object literals
ad49747 Refactored load truck method to truck class
9fc721e Group packages are all in truck 1 and all packages routes for truck 2 are on truck 2
18e2f96 Nearest neighbor algorithm separated into own method from deliver method in truck class
1c4c46d Nearest neighbor algorithm working correctly, all packages are being delivered
1cdedc0 Rudimentary nearest neighbor algorithm created
d534e57 Filled out distance hash so that all buckets for the current address have the same number of addresses and corresponding distances from the starting address key
6b3d6a4 merge
0ff471a distance_hash structure now has identical row and column headers to facilitate address mapping
eaa760d cleaning up headers in distance hash to match all addresses, in progress...
859bac1 added method to distance_hash.py to return shortest distance in a list
46ad82b add method to distance_hash.py to return shortest distance in a list
a5780fc truck class drop_package method updated to drop off all packages in list in order
a1820ce truck class has methods for updating th current: time, inventory, and mileage. distance has table keys have been cleaned up to match packaged addresses
69d25b4 trucks are properly populating
73c68e6 debugged packages hash table, corrected insert and search methods
a2070a6 added hash table for packages
842d895 temporary workaround, loading functions for trucks and packages will remain in file reader file
